# Movie Application (CRUD)

CRUD Movie Application - Nx, NextJs, React, MongoDB, Cypress

## Description

Requirements were to create a display, and modify pages. Within the site the user should also be able to perform basic Create, Read, Update and Delete functionalities. Within those functionalities the user should be able to display movie ratings on the edit/modify page. As well as displaying them on a read-only page with E2E tests wrapping up the project.

## What I learned

It was difficult to learn all of these technologies. Only ones I really knew was just React. Within a span of a few days I managed to undersand most of it, but I really struggled to pick up TypeScript. I made an effort but figured that the functionality and requirements were way more important to do. I had a very difficult time understanding how to connect the api to my mongoDB database. Not integrated the api data to my database, but just displaying both the movie and review in conjuction. Cypress was fun, I've done Jest testing before which helped quite a bit, its good that I picked these up along the way because I will definitely be using NextJs more!

## How to start

```
nx serve movie-app
```

I couldn't really figure out docker, I installed it then read the documentation, it is one hefty beast! Within the parameters of this project and the time given, I unfortunatley didn't use it.
